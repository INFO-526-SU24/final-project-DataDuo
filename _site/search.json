And next group the data by year and count the number of unique polling places for each year.\nAnalysis: Plot with years on the x-axis and number of polling places on the y-axis to visualize trends and also analyze changes in polling places across states.\n\n\n\nAnalysis plan for question 2 :\n\nThe Variables involved: Independent variable - area type (urban/Rural) , Dependent variable - Number of polling Places(count), state, election_date\nPreparation of the data: Classifying each polling place as either urban or rural based on its location. Group the data by area type and count the number of unique polling places for each combination of area type, state, and election date.\nAnalysis: Explore the distribution of polling places between urban and rural areas.

Second, how does the availability of polling places differ between urban and rural areas, and how does this disparity affect voter turnout?
