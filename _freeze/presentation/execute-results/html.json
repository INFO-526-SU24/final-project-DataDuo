The availability and distribution of polling places can significantly impact voter turnout and influence the overall effectiveness of an election. This project aims to analyze the trends in polling place availability across the United States from 2012 to 2020, with a specific focus on temporal changes and geographic disparities. By examining national and state-level data, as well as differences between urban and rural areas, this project seeks to understand the factors influencing polling place changes and their impact on voter accessibility. Through this analysis, we hope to provide insights that can inform policies to enhance voter access and participation in future elections.\n\n\n## Data Sources\n\n-   The polling places data used in this presentation originates from \" The Center for Public Integrity\".\n\n-   The dataset was featured in their September 2020 article titled \"National data release sheds light on past polling place changes\".\n\n## Data Cleaning and Preparation\n\n-   The dataset was grouped using the \"name\" column. We created a looping function that uses the stringdist[^1] function to calculate how similar the surrounding 25 observation (by index) were.\n-   Grouped observations if they were 90% or more similar to each other.\n-   Results in true number of polling locations because some locations host multiple precincts.\n\n[^1]: Stringdist citation\n\n# Question 1\n\n## Jeevana Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Luis' Plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1650}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Q2 \n\n## Jeevana's Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Luis' Plot\n\n\n\n\n",
